# hom_rep
In this project, written by Egor Maximenko and Luis Angel Gonzalez Serrano,
we test various formulas from our mathematical paper
"Complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials with repeating variables".

The code is written in Sagemath.
Each script (sage file) is an independent program.
Therefore, the code is very repetitive.
