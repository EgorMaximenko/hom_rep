# hom_rep
In this project, written by Egor Maximenko and Luis Angel Gonzalez Serrano,
we test various formulas from our mathematical paper
"Complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials with repeating variables".

The code is written in Sagemath.
The code is very repetitive because each script (file) is independent from the others.
